# node-playground

Simple webapplication using mostly [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/). It has a few features using websockets to make
a more interactive website.

These features include:

- Live collaborative markdown editor with multiple rooms
- _coming soon: chatroom..._

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and then run the following commands.

```sh
$ npm install
$ node index
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
